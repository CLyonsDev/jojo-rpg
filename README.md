# JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: The RPG (v1.4)
 JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: The RPG is a [fan made tabletop RPG ruleset](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ReSnZDUvIhpCG0X_8S5C-7P5vBRUb0P08gedAvs0oMc/edit#) created by Esby.
 The character sheet visuals are a work-in-progress, but the system should be fully playable in its current state. If there are any bugs I missed, or suggestions on how to improve the system please let me know!
 
 # Combat
 JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: The RPG uses a custom method of determining initiative. To make use of this system:
 
- Create an encounter.
- Add each player to the combat.
- Click 'Begin Combat'.

Each player will be given an initiative token that they can expend once per-round to perform an action. In order to refund expended tokens, advance to the next round of combat.
